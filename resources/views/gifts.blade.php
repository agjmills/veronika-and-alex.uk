                <p>
                    We are very lucky to have almost everything we need, and having you at our wedding celebration is gift enough!
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, if you would like to contribute to our wedding, we'd be grateful if you might consider
                    donating to our honeymoon fund.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It would be an enormous help for us, and hopefully get us to somewhere magical.
                </p>
